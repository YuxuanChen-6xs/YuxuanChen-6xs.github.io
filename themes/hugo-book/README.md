### Plugins

There are a few features implemented as pluggable `scss` styles. Usually these are features that don't make it to the core but can still be useful.

| Plugin                            | Description                                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/plugins/_numbered.scss`   | Makes headings in markdown numbered, e.g. `1.1`, `1.2`      |
| `assets/plugins/_scrollbars.scss` | Overrides scrollbar styles to look similar across platforms |

To enable plugins, add `@import "plugins/{name}";` to `assets/_custom.scss` in your website root.

### Hugo Internal Templates

There are a few hugo templates inserted in `<head>`

- [Google Analytics](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics)
- [Open Graph](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#open-graph)

To disable Open Graph inclusion you can create your own empty file `\layouts\_internal\opengraph.html`.
In fact almost empty not quite empty because an empty file looks like absent for HUGO. For example:
```
<!-- -->
```

## Shortcodes

- [Buttons](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/buttons/)
- [Columns](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/columns/)
- [Details](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/details/)
- [Hints](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/hints/)
- [KaTeX](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/katex/)
- [Mermaid](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/mermaid/)
- [Tabs](https://hugo-book-demo.netlify.app/docs/shortcodes/tabs/)

By default, Goldmark trims unsafe outputs which might prevent some shortcodes from rendering. It is recommended to set `markup.goldmark.renderer.unsafe=true` if you encounter problems.

```toml
[markup.goldmark.renderer]
  unsafe = true
```

If you are using `config.yaml` or `config.json`, consult the [configuration markup](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration-markup/)

## Versioning

This theme follows a simple incremental versioning. e.g. `v1`, `v2` and so on. There might be breaking changes between versions.

If you want lower maintenance, use one of the released versions. If you want to live on the bleeding edge of changes, you can use the `master` branch and update your website when needed.

Contributions are welcome and I will review and consider pull requests.  
Primary goals are:

- Keep it simple.
- Keep minimal (or zero) default configuration.
- Avoid interference with user-defined layouts.
- Avoid using JS if it can be solved by CSS.

Feel free to open issues if you find missing configuration or customisation options.
